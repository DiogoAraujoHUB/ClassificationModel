## Project Summary
In this project, we created a Classification Model (using Python) for data submitted by the teacher and evaluated it using several different techniques. This project focuses less on the model itself and more on the several different techniques used to make it better or to evaluate it.

The final predictions can be found in the "submission" file, as this had to be delivered as a part of a competition. The competition was based around the results and would compare which group got the model with the most accurate results. 

Our group ended up coming second.
